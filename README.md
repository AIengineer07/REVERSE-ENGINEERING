This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed for cloning of facebook accounts and phishing tasks. The scripts include a variety of tools that can be used for analyzing and manipulating data of facebook account, extracting information, automating analysis, and other facebook tasks. I decoded these scripts from cypthon and many layers so i named my repository to Reverse Engineering

## Introduction

Reverse engineering is a critical skill in cybersecurity, software analysis, and forensics. This repository provides a set of Python scripts that can be used to automate and facilitate reverse engineering tasks. These scripts are open-source and can be freely used and modified.

### Goals:
- Automate common reverse engineering tasks using Python.
- Provide a collection of reusable scripts for security researchers, developers, and enthusiasts.
- Help reverse engineers streamline
